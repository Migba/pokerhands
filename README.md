This is a C# WPF application designed to convert card strings to Poker Hands and determine the winner between two players' hands. It was built using Visual Studio 2015. Please make sure to enter both player names and comma-delimited card strings for the hands.

As this is only a demo project, the focus was mainly on the scoring and validation logic.

If you have any questions regarding the program that are not answered by this README, please feel free to contact me via email.
